# BudgetAgent

Agentic AI orchestrator for **BudgetAI** — it analyzes your spending, builds a budget from
your goals, and drives execution against that budget. It is the "brain" that coordinates the
separate tool repos.

## Repos

| Repo | Role |
|------|------|
| **BudgetAgent** (this) | Orchestrator / agent brain |
| `budget-tool-aggregator` | Pull transactions & balances (bank/credit/mortgage/utility) via Plaid, provider-swappable |
| `budget-tool-analyzer` | Categorize & analyze spending, incl. the petty-cash checking account |
| `budget-tool-planner` | Generate a budget plan from your goals |
| `budget-web` | Visualize progress toward goals |
| `budget-infra` | Azure IaC (Bicep): Key Vault, Storage, web hosting, managed identity |

## The execution lifecycle

1. **Analyze** — aggregate transactions (aggregator tool) → categorize & summarize (analyzer tool).
2. **Plan** — generate a budget from your goals (planner tool).
3. **Propose** — present the plan and any recommended money movements.
4. **Approve** ⛔ — a **human approval gate**. See Safety model.
5. **Execute** — apply approved actions; automatically **track** progress.

## ⚠️ Safety model (read this)

- Account aggregation (Plaid/MX/Finicity) is **read-only**. It can pull balances and
  transactions but **cannot move money**.
- **Autonomous money movement is heavily regulated and risky.** This system is designed so
  that anything that moves money is **approval-gated** by default (`REQUIRE_APPROVAL=true`).
  The agent may *recommend* transfers; a human confirms them until you explicitly opt into a
  narrower, well-tested auto-execute policy (e.g. capped auto-top-ups to the petty-cash
  checking account).
- Fully automated with **no gate**: only *analysis, planning, and progress tracking*.
- Credentials (Plaid keys, bank tokens) live in **Azure Key Vault** (see `budget-infra`),
  never in source control.

## The "petty cash" account

One checking account is designated **petty cash** — personal discretionary spending
(groceries, dining out, clothes). The planner allocates a periodic amount to it; the analyzer
tracks burn-down against that allocation.

                    #   /recommend (read-only), /execute (guardrailed, dry-run only)

```

## Deploy to Azure (Container Apps)

Runs as an **Azure Container App** provisioned by `budget-infra` (the `budgetai-agent`
app on port 8000, bound to the shared managed identity). The infra deployment wires the
tool URLs (`AGGREGATOR_URL`/`ANALYZER_URL`/`PLANNER_URL`) to the deployed tool container
apps and sets `REQUIRE_APPROVAL=true`, `MAX_ACTION_AMOUNT` (per-action guardrail), and
`AZURE_KEY_VAULT_URI`.

Deploy `budget-infra` first, then set the GitHub **secrets** `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` /
`AZURE_TENANT_ID` / `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` and **variables** `AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP`,
`ACR_NAME`, and `CONTAINER_APP_NAME` (`budgetai-agent`). Push to `main` (or run
**Deploy (Agent)**) to build via `az acr build` and roll the container app.

## Recommendation & approval (M5)

The agent supports a **read-only recommendation mode** and a **guardrailed approval
workflow**:

- `POST /recommend` — runs analyze → plan → propose and returns the analysis, budget
  plan, and proposed money actions. Purely read-only: it never moves money. Pass
  `include_advice: true` to also get an LLM narrative (when Azure OpenAI is configured).
- `POST /execute` — validates proposed actions against the approval gate **and** a hard
  per-action limit (`MAX_ACTION_AMOUNT`), reporting each action's would-be outcome
  (`would_execute` / `approval_required` / `rejected_guardrail`). This runs **dry-run
  only** — live money movement is deferred, so no funds are moved. Over-limit actions are
  rejected even with human approval, and every decision is written to the audit log.

Notifications (surfacing recommendations for approval) are handled by the Copilot agent
layer and are out of scope for this service.

## Status

Read-only recommendation mode and a guardrailed, dry-run approval workflow are live.
Live money movement remains deferred pending a reviewed execution adapter.
